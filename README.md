Motivation: In many regions of our country, there is very scant Agricultural Activity. Hence, inorder to supply food grains to these regions, the Govt. establishes Marketplaces wherein traders from all over the country meet to exchange food grains, fruits, cotton and various other Agricultural produce. These markets are usually busy and Crowded areas, bustling with people from all over the country. Naturally, they become a hotspot for the Coronavirus, and the activities in many such markets had to be halted for weeks.

  We believe this turmoil could have easily been prevented, and lives could have been saved. The small Farmers come together, each with their own produce, and reach out to buyers. This involves them travelling in cramped spaces in Tempos or Trucks, with almost no social distancing measures in place. They travel across many states and are most vulnerable to the viral infection. We believe there is an excess and redundant use of manpower in this operation, why risk hundreds of people to buy and sell items that can be done by just one person?. 

  We designed an App that would enable farmers to place orders and sell their produce in bulk, all from the safety of their homes. Any farmer looking for fertilizers, insecticides, seeds etc. could place his order on our App, along with the timeframe within which he wants the required materials. This would be logged into our database and compared with all other entries from the same region, with the similar requirements. These requests would then be clustered together, so that many farmers could place their orders at once. Thus, farmers would not need to venture out of their houses into crowded marketplaces that lack sanitization in search of fertilizers, seeds, etc. Similarly, when they want to sell their produce, they could mutually decide an SPOC(Single Point Of Contact) who would deal with the concerned buyers in person, thus reducing crowded marketplaces.  

  This is the general idea of our app, to pool orders from farmers and reduce their need to go out of their houses.

Technology Stack: We have used flutter for rendering purposes. Flutter was chosen mainly because it has very good compatibility across all kinds of Android devices.
